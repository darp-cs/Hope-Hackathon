                <p>It is important that we are conscious of how our actions impact our planet. With 165 million tons of floating plastic in our oceans and growing 9 million tons every year, we must act now.</p>

                    <p>Follow these Tips Every Day to Reduce Pollution:</p>
                    <li>Conserve energy - at home, at work, everywhere.</li>
<li>Look for the ENERGY STAR label when buying home or office equipment.</li>
<li>Carpool, use public transportation, bike, or walk whenever possible.</li>
<li>Follow gasoline refueling instructions for efficient vapor recovery, being careful not to spill fuel and <li>always tightening your gas cap securely.</li>
<li>Consider purchasing portable gasoline containers labeled “spill-proof,” where available.</li>
<li>Keep car, boat, and other engines properly tuned.</li>
<li>Be sure your tires are properly inflated.</li>
<li>Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products whenever possible.</li>
<li>Mulch or compost leaves and yard waste.</li>
<li>Consider using gas logs instead of wood.</li>

             <h3>Air pollution affects our health, ecosystems, and economy</h3>
             <p>Clean air is a basic requirement for human health. Air pollution can worsen many health conditions. Even levels of air pollution that meet standards can affect people’s health, and scientists are finding health effects at lower levels than we previously realized. Having good air quality means fewer missed work and school days and less money spent on air pollution-related illness. It also supports the ecosystems that Minnesotans value, and provides the foundation for a growing economy.</p>

                  <h1>Planting natives for beauty & biodiversity</h1>
                  <p>Planting a variety of native plants increases biodiversity. We need biodiversity—it runs the ecosystem on which we depend. 
                    Native plants provide food and shelter for wildlife. Many insects require a specific host plant to lay their eggs on and the young to feed on (e.g. monarchs and milkweeds).</p>

                      <p>Composting is an easy way to reduce waste while improving your yard and garden soils. Yard trimmings and food scraps make up nearly 16% to 30% of waste produced by the average household. In Minnesota, 12% is food scraps and up to 18% is yard waste.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, indoor pollutants may be two to five times higher than outdoor levels. And only a fraction of the more than 75,000 registered chemicals have gone through complete testing for human health concerns</p>
